		fpgadata -- FPGA to Raspberry Pi Data Transfer
		----------------------------------------------

A tool set to:
    Transfer data from an FPGA to Raspberry Pi (RPi) via GPIO pins.
    Generate dotplots from csv file data.
    Format and display images from from csv file data.
    Original motivation from CSU Jesse Wilson.

Notes:
------

Man pages:  Are generated from Perl POD source in command scripts (the same
    as shown by --man option).  The manpage format (*.1), and the text
    format (*.txt), have the same content.  The text files are committed
    in the repository so they can be easily viewed without having to compile
    or run code.


Initial Build process:
----------------------

0)  Set up build directories (only in a new working copy).
    % cd src
    % make mkdirs
    % make compile

    The idea is to build/run in the source directory tree, thus avoiding
    need for any package/install process.

    The bin/ dirctory aggregates all commands with symlinks (so it does not
    contain any sources), making it easy to add to $PATH.

    Most tools have an embedded man page, e.g. 'rpixel --man'.
