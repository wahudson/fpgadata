		fpgadata -- FPGA to Raspberry Pi Data Transfer
		----------------------------------------------

A tool set to:
    Transfer data from an FPGA to Raspberry Pi (RPi) via GPIO pins.
    Generate dotplots from csv file data.
    Format and display images from from csv file data.
    Original motivation from CSU Jesse Wilson.

Initial Build process:
----------------------

0)  Set up build directories (only in a new working copy).
    % cd src
    % make mkdirs
    % make compile

    The idea is to build/run in the source directory tree, thus avoiding
    need for any package/install process.

    The bin/ dirctory aggregates all commands with symlinks (so it does not
    contain any sources), making it easy to add to $PATH.

    Most tools have an embedded man page, e.g. 'rpixel --man'.
