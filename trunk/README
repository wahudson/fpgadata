		fpgadata -- FPGA to Raspberry Pi Data Transfer
		----------------------------------------------

Revision control:  subversion
$Id$
$URL$

This is the "fpgadata" tool.
Runs on Raspberry Pi (RPi) to transfer data from an FPGA connected to
the RPi GPIO pins.
Motivation from CSU Jesse Wilson.

Repository layout:
------------------
The subversion repository is structured like this:

    trunk/		Mainline development
    tags/		Release tags
	1.11/
	1.12/
	1.47/
        ...
    branches/		Parallel development branches (unused)


Release directory structure:
----------------------------


Version numbers:
----------------
Version number format is:  X.YY.Z
    major.minor.patch

    major = major release number
    minor = minor release number, 2-digit, no leading 0 zeros
    patch = optional patch number, used when a release tag is patched

Assign new version number by simple incrementing of the appropriate field.
Do NOT try to make larger increments imply larger change, because it won't.

Release tag name IS the version number.  e.g. tags/1.10

? Version number is derived from the tag name in the URL keyword.
    see also:  ToolVersion.pm


Initial Build process: ???
----------------------

0)  Set up build directories (only in a new working copy).
    % cd src
    % make mkdirs
    % make compile


Release process: ???
----------------
The installation directory structure is the same as the trunk/ development
directory structure.  This allows testing to point at either one.

The process is to svn copy trunk/ to a release tag named by the version
number.  This tag is then checked-out (or exported) into a versioned
build directory where the tool is built.  Unmanaged directory trunk/build/ is
used for this purpose (or any other location).

Process key:
    +  is unix command to enter
    >  is svn commit message to enter
    Note standardized svn commit messages for release tags.


0) Inspect existing tags/ and choose a new version number:
    + URL=file:///home/wah/SVN_tool/usblist
    + svn ls -v  $URL/tags

1) Snap a release tag, assigning a new version number:
    + svn copy  $URL/trunk  $URL/tags/X.YY
    > Release:  tags/X.YY

2) Export svn tag into versioned build dir:
    + mkdir  build/X.YY
    + cd     build/X.YY
    + svn co  $URL/tags/X.YY  .

3) Build the Tool:  (in trunk or in build/X.YY/)
    + cd src
    + make mkdirs
    + make compile

4) Test the Tool:  (in trunk or in build/X.YY/)
    + cd test
    + make test

5) Install the Tool:
    Version number is X.YY
    Copy to your bin/ directory.

6) Release notes:
    Put them in $URL/doc/ directory (parallel to trunk/).
    Name files according to the release tag name.
    They are outside of trunk/, so they can be revised independently.

    Examine the svn log:
    + cd ../trunk/
    + svn log -v -rHEAD:1 > /tmp/_rel_YYYY_MM_DD.svnlog

    + cd  ../doc/
    + vi  X.YY.txt
    + svn add     X.YY.txt
    + svn commit  X.YY.txt
    > Release notes:  tags/X.YY
