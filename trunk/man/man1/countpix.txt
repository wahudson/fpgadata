NAME
       countpix -- Count pixels on each scan line

SYNOPSIS
        countpix  [options]
           --not=N           don't report lines of N pixels
         options:
           --help            show command usage and exit
           --man             show man page and exit

DESCRIPTION
       Count the number of pixels in each Xs scan line.  Used to assess the
       uniformity of sync marks in the pixel stream.  (i.e. Sync marks
       derived from analog comparators on galvo drive signals may have noise
       jitter.)

        Input:  (stdin)
        Ys,Xs,c0,c1,c2,..
        1,0,#0f0000,#000000,#ff0000
        0,1,#0f0000,#000000,#ff0000
        ...

       Each input line is one pixel containing sync marks (Ys,Xs) and pixel
       colors for multiple images (c0,c1,..).  The image colors are ignored.

       Input Xs,Ys should be 1 only on the pixel where the sweep should
       reset to the left edge (Xs) or top edge (Ys) of the image, otherwise
       0.

        Output:  (stdout)
         line  cnt
            0   10     # first line may be short, since no Xs has occured
            1  256
            2  256
          ...  ...
           25  257

OPTIONS
       --not=N  - Don't report lines of N pixels.
               Use to ignore lines of a frequently occuring length.

       --help  - Show command usage and exit.
       --man  - Show man page and exit.
               Prints the manual page and exits.

RETURN VALUE
       0= success, otherwise errors

EXAMPLES
        Typical processing pipeline.
        % rpixel --csv | coeff2stream | countpix --not=256

ENVIRONMENT
       PAGER   Value defines an output filter used to display manual pages. 
               By default, less(1) is used.  If PAGER='', stdout is written
               with no paging.

FILES
       none
