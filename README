		fpgadata -- FPGA to Raspberry Pi Data Transfer
		----------------------------------------------

A tool set to:
    Transfer data from an FPGA to Raspberry Pi (RPi) via GPIO pins.
    Generate dotplots from csv file data.
    Format and display images from from csv file data.

Purpose of this project:
------------------------
    These tools were developed for use on a graduate student project at
    Colorado State University.
    The original problem was to get data out of an adaptive filter running
    on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array).
    Later applied to an 8-channel Digital Lockin amplifier on an FPGA.

    The tools meet these needs in a reasonably general way, and could
    find application in other situations.
    Intended to be modified to suit specific needs.

    It is a command line tool set, not a GUI application.
    Intended to run on Linux.


Catalog of Tools:
-----------------
Data transfer:

    rpixel		FPGA data transfer to Raspberry Pi.
	It transfers data, over 8 GPIO pins, from a fifo on the FPGA to the
	Raspberry Pi.  Output is a csv file, where each line is a data set
	of 16 signed integer coefficients along with scan sync marks for
	later interpretation as an image.
	It is a C++ program using /dev/gpiomem memory mapped IO.

    rpixel_init		Initialize Raspberry Pi gpio for use with rpixel.

Dot plots:

    plotc16		Plot FPGA filter coefficients.
	Essentially a generic program to produce a dotplot of csv file data.
	Written in R-script.

    plotc16loop		Live Plot of FPGA filter coefficients.
	Similar, but uses a repeat loop to read data from a named pipe.
	Written in R-script.

    runplots		Run rpixel with plotc16loop.
	A simple wraper script.

Image display:

    simage		Stream data into an image display.
	Displays one image for each column of pixel color values in the input
	csv data stream.  Is a fairly generic program relying on external
	formatting of data.  It is capable of live image update from a slow
	scanning image.
	Written in Perl, using PerlTk to do the imaging.

    coeff2stream	Convert rpixel coefficient data into an image stream.
	This is the transformation from rpixel output to simage input.
	Coefficient data is transformed into RGB pixel value using a palette
	file lookup.
	Rising/falling scan mark edges are detected and turned into single
	pixel scan reset points.
	Written in Perl.

Utility:

    coeff2polar		Multi-lockin coefficient to magnitude and phase.
	Interpret rpixel coefficient values as pairs of lockin quadrature
	values and convert into magnitude and phase.
	An example of data manipulation before feeding to dot plot and
	image tools.
	Written in Perl.

    countpix		Count pixels on each scan line.
	Used to assess the uniformity of sync marks in the pixel stream.
	Written in Perl.

    I am NOT accepting pull requests at this time.

    This is a single-person project of tools I am actively using.
    It is intended that you should fork or copy parts that are useful to
    you and modify to suit your needs.  I am happy you found something
    useful!
